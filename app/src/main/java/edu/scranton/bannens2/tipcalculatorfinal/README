TipCalculatorFinal

I made a tip calculator using the SeekBar. With the SeekBar a person can select any tip percentage that they want.
I also added font size, font style, italicization, and background color.
I also have the tip calculator calculate the tip, the total of the bill, the tip for each person, and the total for each person.
Also that an error alert appears when nothing is inputted in the fields

I attempted at doing fragments so when the user pressed calculate it would bring them to a different page that displayed all the calculations.
I also attempted at doing the Spinner and I left some of my code commented out at the bottom of the MainActivity.
